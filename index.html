        <p>
          The Innovators Premier League (IPL) is an initiative by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) to bring out the best talents from the Kerala Innovation Hubs. IPL aims to create a competitive and entrepreneurial mindset among innovators and students, bringing awareness and sensitization of IEDC and its activities, and creating a pipeline of startups.
          <br><br>During IPL, students from various institutions competed with each other at the college, regional, and state levels under the three major pillars of innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship. The league competition ran on a point system, where institutions and students could earn points by organising and participating in various events and activities such as boot camps, workshops, ideathons, and hackathons.
          <br><br>The closing ceremony for IPL is an event that celebrates the achievements and successes of the participants. It is a platform to showcase the most innovative ideas and startups that have emerged from the league competition. The event will be attended by industry experts, investors, and government officials who will provide feedback, guidance, and support to the participants.
          The closing ceremony will feature speeches from eminent personalities, panel discussions, and networking opportunities for the participants. It will be an excellent opportunity for the participants to connect with potential investors, mentors, and collaborators to take their ideas and startups to the next level.
          <br><br>We invite all participants, stakeholders, and supporters of IPL to join us for this grand event and celebrate the spirit of innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship.
